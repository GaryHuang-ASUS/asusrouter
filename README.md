**AsusRouter** is an API wrapper for communication with ASUSWRT-powered routers using the HTTP protocol.

It is small, only partially done and has a lot of limitations, but with time AsusRouter has a chance to grow into a full-powered control library for your device.

## Installation

Installation of the latest release is available through PyPI:

```
pip install asusrouter
```

## Supported devices and firmware

Currently, **AsusRouter** is tested only on one router model. If you have successfully tested it on other models or with other software, you are welcome to submit a pull request and add more devices.
